# Counter Strike 2 Match Auto Accepter:

Will I Get Banned?
No, it doesn't interact with the game in any way, shape or form, only using image template matching to find the accept button, move the mouse and click 


For Other Devs:
if you want to build and run the code you need to install opencv's library and change ur vc++ directories to match your own etc
